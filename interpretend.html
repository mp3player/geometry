        So far in this chapter, we have viewed probabilities in terms of the frequencies
of random, repeatable events. We shall refer to this as the classical or frequentist
interpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in
which probabilities provide a quantification of uncertainty.
Consider an uncertain event, for example whether the moon was once in its own
orbit around the sun, or whether the Arctic ice cap will have disappeared by the end
of the century. These are not events that can be repeated numerous times in order
to define a notion of probability as we did earlier in the context of boxes of fruit.
Nevertheless, we will generally have some idea, for example, of how quickly we
think the polar ice is melting. If we now obtain fresh evidence, for instance from a
new Earth observation satellite gathering novel forms of diagnostic information, we
may revise our opinion on the rate of ice loss. Our assessment of such matters will
affect the actions we take, for instance the extent to which we endeavour to reduce
the emission of greenhouse gasses. In such circumstances, we would like to be able
to quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of uncertainty in
the light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions
or decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very
general, Bayesian interpretation of probability.
The use of probability to represent uncertainty, however, is not an ad-hoc choice,
but is inevitable if we are to respect common sense while making rational coherent
inferences. For instance, Cox (1946) showed that if numerical values are used to
represent degrees of belief, then a simple set of axioms encoding common sense
properties of such beliefs leads uniquely to a set of rules for manipulating degrees of
belief that are equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability. This provided
the first rigorous proof that probability theory could be regarded as an extension of
Boolean logic to situations involving uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003). Numerous other
authors have proposed different sets of properties or axioms that such measures of
uncertainty should satisfy (Ramsey, 1931; Good, 1950; Savage, 1961; deFinetti,
1970; Lindley, 1982). In each case, the resulting numerical quantities behave pre-
cisely according to the rules of probability. It is therefore natural to refer to these
quantities as (Bayesian) probabilities.
